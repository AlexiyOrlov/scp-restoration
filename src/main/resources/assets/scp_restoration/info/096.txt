Shyguy is a passive creature until a human looks at his head - in this case,
shyguy will cover his face and sob for a while, then becomes enraged - he will
pursue those who viewed its face and kill them, breaking blocks blocking its path.
After the victims are dead, he will return to passive state. He is able to climb
to some extent, and has maximum possible health, which regenerates.
