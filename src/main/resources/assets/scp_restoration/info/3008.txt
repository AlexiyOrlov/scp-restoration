SCP-3008 is a dimension resembling interior of an IKEA furniture store.
It is inhabited by an unknown amount of civilians and SCP-3008-2, humanoid
 entities that wear IKEA employee uniform. SCP-3008-2 are neutral during the
 daytime, and become hostile to all creatures during nighttime. Due to that a
  stranger might encounter small civilian bases amidst the dimension, where some
   useful resources can be found. To enter SCP-3008, the player must be sneaking
   inside the teleportation block.
