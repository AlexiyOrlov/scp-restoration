SCP-3521 is a yellow gel tablet.
After 30 minutes since consumption, the consumer will have his stomach filled
with radioactive bananas, and die. The level of radiation is low, and bananas
 are edible.

Following is an excerpt from a text message conversation recovered
from the cell phone found near the supply of SCP-3521 during its discovery:

- I know you're supposed to be some kind of savant but I don't know about this.
Are you sure that radioactive bananas are more discrete than plutonium?
Because I feel like they aren't.

- u tell me. u see plutonium on ground and u see banana.
