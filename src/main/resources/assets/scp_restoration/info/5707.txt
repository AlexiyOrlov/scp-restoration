Uncle Sam transforms all rotten flesh given to him into random edible meat.
One piece of flesh yields 1-5 pieces of meat. Sam will try to deposit meat into
containers nearby, otherwise he'll drop it on the ground. He needs a sword-like
 item to transform meat. He is a pacifist and thus doesn't fight.
